# C++ Device Simulator (WIP)

MongoDB Realm C++ SDK and demo app is available here https://github.com/realm/realm-cpp.

Official documentation is available here: https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm/sdk/cpp/

As soon as time permits this part of the demo will be extended.
If you have developed something and you are willing to share please let us know!


## OSX Folder

This folder contains a Xcode project with some sample code to get started. The sample code is configured to connect to an Atlas backend, which means you would have to create an Atlas cluster and an Atlas app, then add the App ID to the sample code. I will add some more details soon.

## Ubuntu Folder

Contains a docker file and the required steps to compile the C++ SDK in Ubuntu
